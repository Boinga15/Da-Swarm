# Da-Swarm
Player vs AI tower defence game where you send units to your opponent as they send units at you.

Da Swarm is a Pygame project that pits you against one of six different AI types and has you both fight in a tower defence-style game. You place towers to defend your side from the AI's units while sending units at the AI's side to try defeat them. There are four difficulties for each AI, and each AI type has a different strategy (or no strategy at all depending on how you want to look at it).

The project was made in Python 3.7, but is compatable with 3.10.
